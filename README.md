Vela (a.k.a VelaSynth) is an ongoing work on a Video Synthesizer plugin for the VCVRack project.
More information on this to come. There is still a lot of work to be done.

Inspirations from: [Sandyn Vidsynth](http://www.audiovisualizers.com/toolshak/vidsynth/sandin/sandin.htm), [5 Minute Romp thru the IP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qh6jRzjmcY).
